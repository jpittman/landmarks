*An Apple SwiftUI Tutorial App*

## Background

Having stepped away from development for a bit, I missed somethings. SwiftUI was on my radar, but I didn't really dive in. I only dabbled. To catch up, I started looking around for ways to catch up and found the SwiftUI tutorial in Apple's docs. So here we are, following along and adding code as the tutorial asks me to. I've been digging in a bit where there are new things and refreshing my memory where there are some old things. 

It's a stepping stone to more, but for now it's nice to feel like a noob again.

## Tasks

This is a high level set of tasks. I'll update as it becomes clearer as to what the next steps are (if I can find the time).

- [ ] Complete Tutorial
- [ ] Write some testing against the app
- [ ] Add a new feature or two.
